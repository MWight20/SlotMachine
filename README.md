# SlotMachine
.NET C# Form Application that plays a 3 slot or 5 slot variation of a slot machine

       This program runs a slot machine game. There are two game modes: 3 slot(default mode) and 5 slot, each using a slightly
    varied points reward in a credit system. You are allowed to either choose an existing player profile from a comboBox drop down list,
    create a new user that will be added to the player profile list, or play anonymously as a "guest". 
       
       Spins cost a set amount of money and player is rewarded on obtaining a 3 match or 5 match depending on the game mode. 
    The player will not be able to switch between players until that player has "cashed out" via the button in the bottom
    right. After cashing out, the program will update the players credit value and then write it into the "PlayerList.txt" file.
